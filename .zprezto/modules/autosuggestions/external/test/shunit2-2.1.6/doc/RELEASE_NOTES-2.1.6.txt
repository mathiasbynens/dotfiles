Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.6
===============================

This release contains bug fixes and changes. It is also the first release to
support running shunit2 as a standalone program.

Please read the Shell Errata section of the documentation for guidance on how
to meet these requirements.

See the ``CHANGES-2.1.txt`` file for a full list of changes.

New Features
------------

Support for running shUnit2 as a standalone program. This makes it possible for
users to execute their unit tests in a manner that is not dependent on the
location an OS distribution maintainer chose to place shUnit2 in the file
system.

Added support for functions defined like 'function someFunction()'.

Changes and Enhancements
------------------------

Renamed the public ``shunit_tmpDir`` variable to ``SHUNIT_TMPDIR`` to be more
consistent with the ``TMPDIR`` variable.

Bug Fixes
---------

Fixed issue where shunit2 would fail on some distributions when creating a
temporary directory because the **od** command was not present.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

None.

Known Bugs and Issues
---------------------

Zsh requires the ``shwordsplit`` option to be set. See the documentation for
examples of how to do this.

Line numbers in assert messages do not work properly with BASH 2.x.

The Bourne shell of Solaris, BASH 2.x, and Zsh 3.0.x do not properly catch the
SIGTERM signal. As such, shell interpreter failures due to such things as
unbound variables cannot be caught. (See ``shunit_test_misc.sh``)

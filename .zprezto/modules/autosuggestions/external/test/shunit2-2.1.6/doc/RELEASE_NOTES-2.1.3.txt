Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.3
===============================

This release is minor feature release. It improves support for zsh (although it
still isn't what it could be) and adds automated testing framework support by
returning a non-zero exit when tests fail.

To use zsh with shUnit2, the following two requirements must be met:
* The ``shwordsplit`` option must be set.
* The ``function_argzero`` option must be unset.

Please read the Shell Errata section of the documentation for guidance on how
to meet these requirements.

See the ``CHANGES-2.1.txt`` file for a full list of changes.

Known Bugs and Issues

Functions do not properly test for an invalid number of arguments.

ksh and pdksh do not pass null arguments (i.e. empty strings as '') properly,
and as such checks do not work properly.

zsh requires the ``shwordsplit`` option to be set, and the ``function_argzero``
option to be unset for proper operation.

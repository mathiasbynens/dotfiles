Release Notes for shUnit2 2.1.1
===============================

This is mainly a bug fix release, but it also incorporates a realignment with
the JUnit 4 code. Asserts now provide better failure messages, and the failure
functions no longer perform tests.

See the ``CHANGES-2.1.txt`` file for a full list of changes.

value is considered 'false'.

Self-testing unit tests were added.

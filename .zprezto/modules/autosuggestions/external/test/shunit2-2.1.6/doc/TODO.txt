Make it possible to execute a single test by passing the name of the test on
the command line

Add support for '--randomize-order' so that the test order is randomized to
check for dependencies (which shouldn't be there) between tests.

--debug option to display point in source code (line number and such) where the
problem showed up.

assertTrue() just gives 'ASSERT:', nothing else :-(. others too?
upd: assertNull() will give message passed, but nothing else useful :-(

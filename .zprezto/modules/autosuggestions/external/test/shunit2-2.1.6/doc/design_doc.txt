Design Doc for shUnit

shUnit is based upon JUnit. The initial ideas for the script came from the book
"Pragmatic Unit Testing - In Java with JUnit" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.

The script was written to perform unit testing for log4sh. log4sh had grown
enough that it was becoming difficult to easily test and and verify that the
tests passed for the many different operating systems on which it was being
used.

The functions in shUnit are meant to match those in JUnit as much as possible
where shell allows. In the initial version, there will be no concept of
exceptions (as normal POSIX shell has no concept of them) but attempts to trap
problems will be done.

Programatic Standards:

* SHUNIT_TRUE - public global constant
* __SHUNIT_SHELL_FLAGS - private global constant
* __shunit_oldShellFlags - private global variable

* assertEquals - public unit test function
* shunit_publicFunc - public shUnit function; can be called from parent unit
  test script
* _shunit_privateFunc - private shUnit function; should not be called from
  parent script. meant for internal use by shUnit

* _su_myVar - variable inside a public function. prefixing with '_su_' to
  reduce the chances that a variable outside of shUnit will be overridden.
* _su__myVar - variable inside a private function. prefixing with '_su__' to
  reduce the chances that a variable in a shUnit public function, or a variable
  outside of shUnit will be overridden.

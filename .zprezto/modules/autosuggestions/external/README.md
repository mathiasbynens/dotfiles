## Installation

### Manual

1. Clone this repository somewhere on your machine. This guide will assume `~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions`.

    ```sh
    git clone git://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions
    ```

2. Add the following to your `.zshrc`:

    ```sh
    source ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
    ```

3. Start a new terminal session.


### Oh My Zsh

1. Clone this repository into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` (by default `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`)

    ```sh
    git clone git://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
    ```

2. Add the plugin to the list of plugins for Oh My Zsh to load:

    ```sh
    plugins=(zsh-autosuggestions)
    ```

3. Start a new terminal session.


## Usage

As you type commands, you will see a completion offered after the cursor in a muted gray color. This color can be changed by setting the `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE` variable. See [configuration](#configuration).

If you press the <kbd>â†’</kbd> key (`forward-char` widget) or <kbd>End</kbd> (`end-of-line` widget) with the cursor at the end of the buffer, it will accept the suggestion, replacing the contents of the command line buffer with the suggestion.

If you invoke the `forward-word` widget, it will partially accept the suggestion up to the point that the cursor moves to.


## Configuration

You may want to override the default global config variables after sourcing the plugin. Default values of these variables can be found [here](src/config.zsh).

**Note:** If you are using Oh My Zsh, you can put this configuration in a file in the `$ZSH_CUSTOM` directory. See their comments on [overriding internals](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#overriding-internals).


### Suggestion Highlight Style

Set `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_HIGHLIGHT_STYLE` to configure the style that the suggestion is shown with. The default is `fg=8`.


### Widget Mapping

This plugin works by triggering custom behavior when certain [zle widgets](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html#Zle-Widgets) are invoked. You can add and remove widgets from these arrays to change the behavior of this plugin:

- `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_CLEAR_WIDGETS`: Widgets in this array will clear the suggestion when invoked.
- `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS`: Widgets in this array will accept the suggestion when invoked.
- `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_PARTIAL_ACCEPT_WIDGETS`: Widgets in this array will partially accept the suggestion when invoked.

Widgets not in any of these lists will update the suggestion when invoked.

**Note:** A widget shouldn't belong to more than one of the above arrays.


### Key Bindings

This plugin provides two widgets that you can use with `bindkey`:

1. `autosuggest-accept`: Accepts the current suggestion.
2. `autosuggest-clear`: Clears the current suggestion.

For example, this would bind <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> to accept the current suggestion.

```sh
bindkey '^ ' autosuggest-accept
```

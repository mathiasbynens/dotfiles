zsh-syntax-highlighting / highlighters / line
---------------------------------------------

This is the `line` highlighter, that highlights the whole line.


### How to tweak it

This highlighter defines the following styles:

* `line` - the style for the whole line

To override one of those styles, change its entry in `ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES`,
for example in `~/.zshrc`:

    ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[line]='bold'

The syntax for values is the same as the syntax of "types of highlighting" of
the zsh builtin `$zle_highlight` array, which is documented in [the `zshzle(1)`
manual page][zshzle-Character-Highlighting].

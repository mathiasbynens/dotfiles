zsh-syntax-highlighting / highlighters / root
---------------------------------------------

This is the `root` highlighter, that highlights the whole line if the current
user is root.


### How to tweak it

This highlighter defines the following styles:

* `root` - the style for the whole line if the current user is root.

To override one of those styles, change its entry in `ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES`,
for example in `~/.zshrc`:

    ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_STYLES[root]='bg=red'

The syntax for values is the same as the syntax of "types of highlighting" of
the zsh builtin `$zle_highlight` array, which is documented in [the `zshzle(1)`
manual page][zshzle-Character-Highlighting].

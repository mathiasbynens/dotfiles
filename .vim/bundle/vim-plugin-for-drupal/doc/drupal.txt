The functionality mentioned here is provided by several files.  See the
installation section.

==============================================================================
1. Installation                    *drupal-installation* *drush-vimrc-install*

INSTALLATION WITH DRUSH

This is the recommended method. Drush will download this project to
~/.drush/vimrc (or to /usr/share/drush/commands/vimrc--see `drush help dl`).
Then the installation script will install Pathogen, if needed, and continue as
described below. You can install to another directory if you prefer. From a
command line, >
        $ drush @none dl vimrc
        $ drush help vimrc-install
        $ drush -v vimrc-install <options>
If the drush version is at least 5.5, then the recommended plugins will be
installed in the bundle/ subdirectry of your vimfiles directory.

INSTALLATION AS A VIM 8 PACKAGE

If you use Vim 8, then you can install most of this project using the new
|package| feature.

Download this project to your packages directory, usually `~/.vim/pack/`, and
rename the `bundle` subdirectory to `start`. Then you should have, for example,
`~/.vim/pack/vimrc/start/vim-plugin-for-drupal/plugin/drupal.vim`.

Before the line >
	filetype plugin on
in your vimrc file, add the lines >
	if v:version >= 800
	  packloadall
	endif
This will enable the `filetype.vim` in this project when determining file types.
You can omit the version check if you only use Vim 8.

The only thing you lose with this method are the drush commands. If you want
to use them, then you can copy or symlink `vimrc.drush.inc` from this project to
a directory that drush searches for commands, such as `~/.drush`.

INSTALLATION WITH PATHOGEN

Pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332) is a package
manager for vim. Using Pathogen, the files from this project will be kept
separate from other Vim plugins, so it is easier to update or remove, and you
do not have to worry about name collisions.

With Pathogen, you can install this project anywhere you like.  One suggestion
is to create ~/.drush/vimrc and put it there.  Explicitly, the documentation
will be >
        ~/.drush/vimrc/bundle/vim-plugin-for-drupal/doc/drupal.txt (Linux etc.)
        ~\.drush\vimrc\bundle\vim-plugin-for-drupal\doc\drupal.txt (Windows)
Then add the line >
        :call pathogen#infect('~/.drush/vimrc/bundle')
to your |vimrc| file.  (The Windows variant is left as an exercise.)  Another
suggestion is to make a symbolic link to the bundle/ directory under your
|vimfiles| directory. Explicitly, >
        $ mkdir ~/.vim/bundle
        $ ln -s path/to/vimrc/bundle/vim-plugin-for-drupal ~/.vim/bundle
In this case, add the line >
        :call pathogen#infect()
to your |vimrc| file if it is not already there.

In either case, you can use the command >
        :Helptags
instead of |:helptags|, and let pathogen figure out the path for you.

BASIC INSTALLATION (without pathogen)

Copy the files from the bundle/vim-plugin-for-drupal/ subdirectory into your
|vimfiles| directory.  If you have downloaded these files as vimrc.tar.gz and
your vimfiles directory is ~/.vim, then this should work on UNIX-like systems: >
        $ cd ~/.vim
        $ tar xzf path/to/vimrc.tar.gz --strip-components 3 \
                  vimrc/bundle/vim-plugin-for-drupal
Note:  if there are filename conflicts, then tar will silently overwrite the
existing files.

When you are done, you should have the following directory structure inside
your |vimfiles| directory: >
        autoload/drupal.vim
        compiler/coder.vim
        doc/drupal.txt
        ftdetect/drupal.vim
        ftplugin/drini.vim
        ftplugin/drupal.vim
        plugin/drupal.vim
        snipmate/drupal/php.snippets
        snipmate/drupal6/php.snippets
        snipmate/drupal7/php.snippets
        syntax/drini.vim
        syntax/drupal.vim
        tagfiles/drupal6.tags
        tagfiles/drupal7.tags
        tagfiles/drupal8.tags

In order to use the tags defined in this help file, start vim and >
        :helptags ~/.vim/doc
(assuming that this file is installed as ~/.vim/doc/drupal.txt).  See
|add-local-help| for details.

SAMPLE VIMRC FILES

If you are new to vim (or have never bothered to configure it before) then you
may want to use one of the supplied vimrc files.  You can copy one of them to
$HOME/.vimrc (or $HOME\_vimrc on Windows:  see |vimrc|) or |:source| one of
them from your own vimrc file.  If you already have a vimrc file, then you may
want to copy some settings from these files.  See also |vimrc_example.vim|. >
        vimrc_minimal.vim:  very basic
        vimrc_standard.vim:  this will :source vimrc_example.vim
        vimrc_timplunkett.vim:  this has many settings, with comments.
When the vimrc project first started, it was one file, similar to
vimrc_timplunkett.vim.  Now that the project contains many files, and some
users are bothered by the original choices, we have moved these settings into
this optional file.

AUTOCOMPLETION IN .INFO FILES

The drini (DRupal INI) filetype is used for .info and similar files.  The
syntax/drini.vim included in this project defines keywords that can be
auto-completed using syntaxcomplete.vim, but this requires version 8.0 of that
script.  Version 7.0 is included in the vim 7.3 distribution (in the autoload/
directory) and is also available from
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3172 .  As of late 2011, the
only way to get version 8.0 is to patch version 7.0 with the patch at
http://drupal.org/node/1303122#comment-5213300 .

TODO:  There should be a way to install with drush.

==============================================================================
2. Filetype detection                                   *drupal-filetypes*

The file ftdetect/drupal.vim ensures that files with these extensions are
recognized as PHP: >
        .module, .php, .install, .inc, .profile, .theme, .engine, .test, .view
and these are recognized as drini (DRupal INI) format: >
        .info, .make, .build
This assumes that you have |filetype| detection on.  See also |ftdetect|.

==============================================================================
3. Drupal plugin                                        *drupal-plugin*

GLOBAL OPTIONS                                          *drupal-global*
The file plugin/drupal.vim sets several |options|.  These will apply whether
or not you are editing Drupal-related files:
        'backspace'=2
        'nocompatible'
        'encoding'=utf-8
        'fileformats'=unix
        'formatoptions'=1
        'history'=300
        'hlsearch'
        'incsearch'
        'linebreak'
        'number'
        'pastetoggle'=<F2>
        'ruler'
        'scrolloff'=2
        'showmatch'
        'showmode'
        'undodir'=~/.vim_runtime/undodir
        'undofile'
        'wildmode'=longest,list

GLOBAL MAPPINGS                                                 *drupal-maps*
The script defines the following mappings: >
        :nn [5C <C-W>w
        :nn [5R <C-W>W
        :map <S-u> :redo<cr>
        :map <C-n> :tabn<cr>
        :map <C-p> :tabp<cr>

DRUPAL MAGIC                    *drupal-magic* *DrupalInit* *b:Drupal_info*
When you edit a Drupal file, the script tries to find the root of your Drupal
installation and a .info file for your current project.  If it succeeds, then
it defines the |buffer-variable| b:Drupal_info, a |Dictionary| with the
following keys:
        DRUPAL_ROOT:    the path to your Drupal installation
        INFO_FILE:      the path to your project's .info file
        OPEN_COMMAND:   a command for opening URL's on your system
        TYPE:           "module" or "theme", as appropriate for the project
        CORE:           the Drupal main version number
Explicitly, b:Drupal_info.OPEN_COMMAND is set to "open" on Mac OS X,
"cygstart" on Windows/Cygwin, "cmd /c start" on other Windows, and "xdg-open"
on UNIX-like systems.

The script always defines all these keys.  If it cannot determine a reasonable
value, it will use an empty string.

                                                               *g:Drupal_dirs*
If you are editing a project that is not inside your Drupal root, then it
should still be able to determine the version of Drupal core.  In this case,
define the |Dictionary| g:Drupal_dirs in your vimrc file.

The keys of the Dictionary should be the versions of Drupal core you use, and
the value should be an absolute path to the corresponding Drupal root.  For
example, >

        :let g:Drupal_dirs = {6: '/var/www/drupal6.22', 7: '/path/to/D7'}

Then the script will set b:Drupal_info.DRUPAL_ROOT to the directory
corresponding to the value of b:Drupal_info.CORE.

The |drupal-ftplugin| file uses b:Drupal_info.DRUPAL_ROOT to define the
environment variable $DRUPAL_ROOT.  This is done using a |BufEnter|
autocommand, so the variable will be set correctly even if you switch between
files related to different versions of Drupal.

MISCELLANEOUS                                           *drupal-miscellaneous*
In addition, this script
        - sets |:filetype| detection and |ftplugin| support on;
        - sets the global variables php_htmlInStrings and
          php_parent_error_open used by the |php-syntax| file;
        - tells vim to jump to the last position when reopening a file;
        - and it highlights trailing whitespace as Error in Drupal files.

==============================================================================
4. Drupal filetype plugin                       *ft-drupal* *drupal-ftplugin*

When editing a Drupal file, "drupal" is added as a secondary 'filetype'.  For
example, 'filetype' may be set to "php.drupal" when editing a PHP file or to
"css.drupal" when editing a CSS file.  When this happens, ftplugin/drupal.vim
is |:source|d.

LOCAL OPTIONS                                           *ft-drupal-options*
The ftplugin file sets the following options:
        'autoindent'
        'expandtab'
        'formatoptions'+=croql
        'formatoptions'-=t
        'nojoinspaces'
        'shiftwidth'=2
        'smartindent'
        'smarttab'
        'tabstop'=2
        'tags'
        'textwidth'=80
This helps you to follow Drupal coding standards:  vim will indent with
spaces, not tabs, and vim will not add a second line when joining a line
ending in "." to the line below.  Comments (both doc blocks and //-style) will
automatically break at 80 characters, and you can reformat them with |gq|.

The 'tags' option is modified only if the CORE and DRUPAL_ROOT keys are
defined in |b:Drupal_info|.  See |drupal-tags| and |ft-drupal-omni|.

                                                        *ft-drupal-syntax*
The script syntax/drupal.vim also encourages you to follow Drupal coding
standards by highlighting comments as errors if they are longer than 80
characters.

PHP SETTINGS                                            *drupal-PHP*
The file ftplugin/drupal.vim sets the following options when editing PHP
files:
        'comments'
        'ignorecase'
        'smartcase'
You can start a doc block with
"/**<CR>" and the indentation and comment leader will be inserted.  To end the
block, just type "<CR>/" and the inserted "* " will automatically turn into
"*/".  To delete the automatically inserted "// ", you can use <C-U>.

LOCAL MAPPINGS                                          *drupal-local-maps*
The ftplugin file also defines the following buffer-local mappings:

                                                     *drupal-api* *drupal-\da*
\da     Look up the API docs for a drupal function under cursor and open it in
        a web browser.
                                                    *drupal-hook* *drupal-\dh*
\dh     Look up the API docs for a hook implemented by the drupal function
        under the cursor and open it in a web browser.
                                                 *drupal-contrib* *drupal-\dc*
\dc     Same as \da but use http://drupalcontrib.org/.
                                              *drupal-drush-API* *drupal-\dda*
\dda    Look up the API docs for a drush function under cursor and open it in
        a web browser.
                                                *drupal-variable* *drupal-\dv*
\dv     Get the value of the drupal variable under cursor.  (Requires drush.)

You can define the |maplocalleader| variable to be something other than the
default if you do not want these maps to start with a backslash.

==============================================================================
5. Editing .info files                          *drupal-info* *drupal-drini*

Files with the extension .info, .make, and .build are recognized as "dot info"
files and given the filetype drini (for DRupal INI).  Keys and values are
highlighted:  standard keys with the Identifier highlight group and other keys
with the Keyword group.  Drupal coding standards are observed.  For example,
the name should start with an uppercase letter and the rest should be
lowercase; the description should start with an uppercase letter and end with
a period.  If dependencies include version restrictions, then these are
highlighted with the |WarningMsg| group.

The 'omnifunc' option is set to use syntax-based completion:  keywords can be
completed with CTRL-X CTRL-O. See |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O| and |syntax-omni|.  This
works best with version 8.0 or later of the script syntaxcomplete.vim.
Version 7.0 is included with vim 7.3, in the $VIMRUNTIME/autocomplete
directory, and is available from
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3172 .  As of late 2011, the
only way to get version 8.0 is to start with 7.0 and apply the patch at
http://drupal.org/node/1303122#comment-5213300 .

==============================================================================
6. Tag searches for Drupal core                   *drupal-tags* *$DRUPAL_ROOT*
                                  *drupal6.tags* *drupal7.tags* *drupal8.tags*

If the scripts can determine the root of your Drupal installation, then they
will set the environment variable $DRUPAL_ROOT and add the appropriate tags
file (currently drupal6.tags, drupal7.tags, or drupal8.tags) to the 'tags'
option.  This lets you use vim's |tag-commands| to jump to functions and more
that are defined in Drupal core.  For example, if the cursor is on the start
of the line >
        drupal_set_message('Hello, world!');
then you can use <C-W>] to open drupal/includes/bootstrap.inc in a new window
and jump to the definition of drupal_set_message().  See also section |29.1|
in the user manual and |window-tag|.
                                                         *drush-vimrc-tag-gen*
If your system has |Exuberant_ctags| and drush installed, then you can create
tags files for your own projects, contrib projects, or your entire Drupal
installation with the included vimrc-tag-gen (alias tags) drush command. For
details, see >
  $ drush help vimrc-tag-gen
or >
  :Drush help vimrc-tag-gen

==============================================================================
7. Drupal/PHP omni-completion                           *ft-drupal-omni*

The default |ftplugin| for PHP sets the 'omnifunc' option to use the PHP
omni-completion script included in the standard vim distribution.  This script
can use tags files to offer completions.  It always completes standard PHP
functions.  If the scripts in this project can determine the root of your
Drupal installation, then Drupal core functions and more can be completed.  If
you provide tags files for your own projects, or contributed modules and
themes, then their functions will also be completed.

To trigger omnicompletion, type <C-X><C-O> in Insert mode.  For example, you
can type >
        drupal_se<C-X><C-O>
to find 15 possible completions, including drupal_send_headers() and
drupal_set_message().  See |compl-omni|.

==============================================================================
8. Coder support                        *ft-drupal-coder* *ft-drupal-make*

If you install and enable the Coder module, then it includes a PHP script that
will correct coding violations, saving the original file as
<filename>.coder.orig and replacing the file with the corrected one.  The
vimrc project includes a |:compiler| plugin that invokes the Coder script.  To
set the compiler, simply >
        :compiler coder
and then use the |:make| command: >
        :make %         " % refers to the current file.
        :e!             " re-load the updated file.
        :diffsplit %.coder.orig
to update the file and compare with the original version in |diff-mode|.  (See
also |08.7| in the users' manual for an introduction to diff mode.)  After
setting the compiler, you can also update other files or entire directories: >
        :make another_file.php
        :make includes/myfile.inc
        :make includes/
        :make .         " . refers to vim's working directory
        :make %:p:h     " directory of the current file

==============================================================================
9. Drush integration                            *drupal-drush* *drupal-:Drush*

See also |vimrc-install|, |vimrc-tag-gen|, |drupal-\dv|, and |drupal-\dda|.

If drush is installed, then the command >
        :Drush <subcommand>
will execute the subcommand using drush and save the output in a scratch
buffer.  This only works for non-interactive commands; you can use the --yes
or --no drush flags if you are sure.  Subcommands and site aliases (start with
'@') are completed intelligently. |cmdline-completion| Examples: >
        :Drush help
        " Compare installed packages on local and stage:
        :Drush @local pml
        :diffthis
        :Drush @stage pml
        :diffthis
        " Living dangerously:
        :Drush --yes rsync @stage:%files @local:%files

==============================================================================
10. GUI menus                           *drupal-menus* *drupal-CreateMaps*

If you are using a GUI version of vim (as opposed to running vim in a terminal
window) then there are several options available under the Drupal menu.  You
can add your own menus, including command-line hints, using
drupal#CreateMaps().  Example: >
        :let s:options = {'root': 'Drupal', 'special': '<buffer>'}
        :nmap <Plug>DrupalAPI :silent call <SID>OpenURL("api.d.o")<CR><C-L>
        :call drupal#CreateMaps('n', 'Drupal API', '<LocalLeader>da',
                \ '<Plug>DrupalAPI', s:options)
These lines (from ftplugin/drupal.vim) define the menu item
'Drupal.Drupal API' with the command-line hint |\da|, calling the s:OpenURL()
function to open api.drupal.org on the page describing the function under the
cursor.  The "n" argument indicates that this menu item is available only in
Normal mode.

Some menu items perform complicated or rarely-used tasks. Others are there
mostly to teach you the keyboard shortcuts. Here is a summary of the menus:

Tag commands: Drupal.Tags |tag-commands|                    *drupal-menu-tags*
  Tag under cursor:
    Jump to the definition of the keyword under the cursor. |CTRL-]|
  Ditto, split window:
    Open a new window and jump to the definition of the keyword under the
    cursor. |CTRL-W_]|
  Got to a tag.:
    Enter a tag, such as "node.module", on the command line. |:tag|
  Ditto, split window:
    Enter a tag on the command line and split the window. |:stag|
  Search for tag.:
    Enter a |pattern|, such as "drupal_set_" or "node_.*form\>", on the
    command line. |:tag|
  Ditto, split window:
    Enter a |pattern| on the command line and split the window. |:stag|
  Choose one match.:
    See a list of all tag matches for the previous tag command and jump to one
    of them. Even if you use a complete tag, there may be multiple matches.
    For example, "execute" is defined for several database-related classes.
    |:tselect|
  tag-gen options:
    Show the help text for the |vimrc-tag-gen| drush command, using |:Drush|.
  tag-gen current project:
    Generate a tags file for the current project (module, theme, etc.) using
    |vimrc-tag-gen|.
  tag-gen Drupal root:
    Generate a tags file for the Drupal root directory using |vimrc-tag-gen|.
    See |$DRUPAL_ROOT|.

The three tag-gen menu items are only present if exuberant |ctags| is in your
path or one of /usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/.

11. Drupal snippets                                     *drupal-snippets*

This project includes many snippets, organized by Drupal version, for use with
the snipMate plugin (https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim).  If you have
installed snipMate.vim, then see |snipMate-usage| for details.  (After
installing snipMate.vim, you should have used |:Helptags| or |:helptags| to

hook_block().

1. Intro                                                       *NERDCommenter*

The NERD commenter provides many different commenting operations and styles
which are invoked via key mappings and a menu. These operations are available
for most filetypes.

There are also options that allow to tweak the commenting engine to your
taste.

==============================================================================
2. Installation                                          *NERDComInstallation*

The NERD Commenter requires Vim 7 or higher.

Extract the plugin files in your ~/.vim (*nix) or ~/vimfiles (Windows). You
should have 2 files: >
    plugin/NERD_commenter.vim
    doc/NERD_commenter.txt
<
Next, to finish installing the help file run: >
    :helptags ~/.vim/doc
<
See |add-local-help| for more details.

Make sure that you have filetype plugins enabled, as the script makes use of
|'commentstring'| where possible (which is usually set in a filetype plugin).
See |filetype-plugin-on| for details, but basically, stick this in your vimrc >
    filetype plugin on
<

==============================================================================
3. Functionality provided                               *NERDComFunctionality*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Functionality summary                        *NERDComFunctionalitySummary*

The following key mappings are provided by default (there is also a menu
with items corresponding to all the mappings below):

[count]|<Leader>|cc |NERDComComment|
Comment out the current line or text selected in visual mode.


[count]|<Leader>|cn |NERDComNestedComment|
Same as |<Leader>|cc but forces nesting.


[count]|<Leader>|c<space> |NERDComToggleComment|
Toggles the comment state of the selected line(s). If the topmost selected
line is commented, all selected lines are uncommented and vice versa.


[count]|<Leader>|cm |NERDComMinimalComment|
Comments the given lines using only one set of multipart delimiters.


[count]|<Leader>|ci |NERDComInvertComment|
Toggles the comment state of the selected line(s) individually.


[count]|<Leader>|cs |NERDComSexyComment|
Comments out the selected lines ``sexily''


[count]|<Leader>|cy |NERDComYankComment|
Same as |<Leader>|cc except that the commented line(s) are yanked first.


|<Leader>|c$ |NERDComEOLComment|
Comments the current line from the cursor to the end of line.


|<Leader>|cA |NERDComAppendComment|
Adds comment delimiters to the end of line and goes into insert mode between
them.


|NERDComInsertComment|
Adds comment delimiters at the current cursor position and inserts between.
Disabled by default.


|<Leader>|ca |NERDComAltDelim|
Switches to the alternative set of delimiters.


[count]|<Leader>|cl
[count]|<Leader>|cb    |NERDComAlignedComment|
Same as |NERDComComment| except that the delimiters are aligned down the
left side (|<Leader>|cl) or both sides (|<Leader>|cb).


[count]|<Leader>|cu |NERDComUncommentLine|
Uncomments the selected line(s).


With the optional repeat.vim plugin (vimscript #2136), the mappings can also
be repeated via |.|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Functionality details                        *NERDComFunctionalityDetails*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.1 Comment map                                             *NERDComComment*

Default mapping: [count]|<Leader>|cc
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterComment
Applicable modes: normal visual visual-line visual-block.


Comments out the current line. If multiple lines are selected in visual-line
mode, they are all commented out.  If some text is selected in visual or
visual-block mode then the script will try to comment out the exact text that
is selected using multi-part delimiters if they are available.

If a [count] is given in normal mode, the mapping works as though that many
lines were selected in visual-line mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.2 Nested comment map                                *NERDComNestedComment*

Default mapping: [count]|<Leader>|cn
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterNested
Applicable modes: normal visual visual-line visual-block.

Performs nested commenting.  Works the same as |<Leader>|cc except that if a line
is already commented then it will be commented again.

If |'NERDUsePlaceHolders'| is set then the previous comment delimiters will
be replaced by place-holder delimiters if needed.  Otherwise the nested
comment will only be added if the current commenting delimiters have no right
delimiter (to avoid syntax errors)

If a [count] is given in normal mode, the mapping works as though that many
lines were selected in visual-line mode.

|'NERDDefaultNesting'|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.3 Toggle comment map                                *NERDComToggleComment*

Default mapping: [count]|<Leader>|c<space>
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterToggle
Applicable modes: normal visual-line.

Toggles commenting of the lines selected. The behaviour of this mapping
depends on whether the first line selected is commented or not.  If so, all
selected lines are uncommented and vice versa.

With this mapping, a line is only considered to be commented if it starts with
a left delimiter.

If a [count] is given in normal mode, the mapping works as though that many
lines were selected in visual-line mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.4 Minimal comment map                              *NERDComMinimalComment*

Default mapping: [count]|<Leader>|cm
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterMinimal
Applicable modes: normal visual-line.

Comments the selected lines using one set of multipart delimiters if possible.

For example: if you are programming in c and you select 5 lines and press
|<Leader>|cm then a '/*' will be placed at the start of the top line and a '*/'
will be placed at the end of the last line.

Sets of multipart comment delimiters that are between the top and bottom
selected lines are replaced with place holders (see |'NERDLPlace'|) if
|'NERDUsePlaceHolders'| is set for the current filetype. If it is not, then
the comment will be aborted if place holders are required to prevent illegal
syntax.

If a [count] is given in normal mode, the mapping works as though that many
lines were selected in visual-line mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.5 Invert comment map                                *NERDComInvertComment*

Default mapping: |<Leader>|ci
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterInvert
Applicable modes: normal visual-line.

Inverts the commented state of each selected line. If the selected line is
commented then it is uncommented and vice versa. Each line is examined and
commented/uncommented individually.

With this mapping, a line is only considered to be commented if it starts with
a left delimiter.

If a [count] is given in normal mode, the mapping works as though that many
lines were selected in visual-line mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.6 Sexy comment map                                    *NERDComSexyComment*

Default mapping: [count]|<Leader>|cs
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterSexy
Applicable modes: normal, visual-line.

Comments the selected line(s) ``sexily''. See |NERDComSexyComments| for
a description of what sexy comments are. Can only be done on filetypes for
which there is at least one set of multipart comment delimiters specified.

Sexy comments cannot be nested and lines inside a sexy comment cannot be
commented again.

If a [count] is given in normal mode, the mapping works as though that many
lines were selected in visual-line mode.

|'NERDCompactSexyComs'|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.7 Yank comment map                                    *NERDComYankComment*

Default mapping: [count]|<Leader>|cy
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterYank
Applicable modes: normal visual visual-line visual-block.

Same as |<Leader>|cc except that it yanks the line(s) that are commented first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.8 Comment to EOL map                                   *NERDComEOLComment*

Default mapping: |<Leader>|c$
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterToEOL
Applicable modes: normal.

Comments the current line from the current cursor position up to the end of
the line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.9 Append com to line map                            *NERDComAppendComment*

Default mapping: |<Leader>|cA
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterAppend
Applicable modes: normal.

Appends comment delimiters to the end of the current line and goes
to insert mode between the new delimiters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.10 Insert comment map                               *NERDComInsertComment*

Default mapping: disabled by default.
Map it to: <plug>NERDCommenterInsert
Applicable modes: insert.

Adds comment delimiters at the current cursor position and inserts
between them.

NOTE: prior to version 2.1.17 this was mapped to <C-c>. To restore this
mapping add >
    imap <C-c> <plug>NERDCommenterInsert
<
to your vimrc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.11 Use alternate delims map                              *NERDComAltDelim*

Default mapping: |<Leader>|ca
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterAltDelims
Applicable modes: normal.

Changes to the alternative commenting style if one is available. For example,
if the user is editing a c++ file using // comments and they hit |<Leader>|ca
then they will be switched over to /**/ comments.

See also |NERDComDefaultDelims|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.12 Comment aligned maps                            *NERDComAlignedComment*

Default mappings: [count]|<Leader>|cl   [count]|<Leader>|cb
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterAlignLeft
           <plug>NERDCommenterAlignBoth
Applicable modes: normal visual-line.

Same as |<Leader>|cc except that the comment delimiters are aligned on the left
side or both sides respectively. These comments are always nested if the
line(s) are already commented.

If a [count] is given in normal mode, the mapping works as though that many
lines were selected in visual-line mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.13 Uncomment line map                               *NERDComUncommentLine*

Default mapping: [count]|<Leader>|cu
Mapped to: <plug>NERDCommenterUncomment
Applicable modes: normal visual visual-line visual-block.

Uncomments the current line. If multiple lines are selected in
visual mode then they are all uncommented.

When uncommenting, if the line contains multiple sets of delimiters then the
``outermost'' pair of delimiters will be removed.

The script uses a set of heuristics to distinguish ``real'' delimiters from
``fake'' ones when uncommenting. See |NERDComIssues| for details.

If a [count] is given in normal mode, the mapping works as though that many
lines were selected in visual-line mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Sexy Comments                                        *NERDComSexyComments*
These are comments that use one set of multipart comment delimiters as well as
one other marker symbol. For example: >
    /*
     * This is a c style sexy comment
     * So there!
     */

    /* This is a c style sexy comment
     * So there!
     * But this one is ``compact'' style */
<
Here the multipart delimiters are /* and */ and the marker is *.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 The NERDComment function                             *NERDComNERDComment*

All of the NERD commenter mappings and menu items invoke a single function
which delegates the commenting work to other functions. This function is
public and has the prototype: >
    function! NERDComment(mode, type)
<
The arguments to this function are simple:
    - mode: a character indicating the mode in which the comment is requested:
     'n' for Normal mode, 'x' for Visual mode
    - type: is used to specify what type of commenting operation is to be
      performed, and it can be one of the following: "sexy", "invert",
      "minimal", "toggle", "alignLeft", "alignBoth", "comment", "nested",
      "toEOL", "append", "insert", "uncomment", "yank"

For example, if you typed >
    :call NERDComment(1, 'sexy')
<
then the script would do a sexy comment on the last visual selection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 The hooks                                                   *NERDComHooks*
|fu! NERDCommenter_before()|  Before NERDComment/SwitchToAlternativeDelimiters
|fu! NERDCommenter_after()|    After NERDComment/SwitchToAlternativeDelimiters

For example, in order to handle different language blocks embedded in the same
file such as |vim-vue|, you can change the filetype, comment something and
change the filetype back: >
    let g:ft = ''
    fu! NERDCommenter_before()
        if &ft == 'vue'
            let g:ft = 'vue'
            let stack = synstack(line('.'), col('.'))
            if len(stack) > 0
                let syn = synIDattr((stack)[0], 'name')
                if len(syn) > 0
                    let syn = tolower(syn)
                    exe 'setf '.syn
                endif
            endif
        endif
    endfu
    fu! NERDCommenter_after()
        if g:ft == 'vue'
            setf vue
            let g:ft = ''
        endif
    endfu
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3 Options details                                    *NERDComOptionsDetails*

To enable any of the below options you should put the given line in your
~/.vimrc

                                                       *'loaded_nerd_comments'*
If this script is driving you insane you can turn it off by setting this
option >
    let loaded_nerd_comments=1
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *'NERDAllowAnyVisualDelims'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

If set to 1 then, when doing a visual or visual-block comment (but not a
visual-line comment), the script will choose the right delimiters to use for
the comment. This means either using the current delimiters if they are
multipart or using the alternative delimiters if THEY are multipart.  For
example if we are editing the following java code: >
    float foo = 1221;
    float bar = 324;
    System.out.println(foo * bar);
<
If we are using // comments and select the "foo" and "bar" in visual-block
mode, as shown left below (where '|'s are used to represent the visual-block
boundary), and comment it then the script will use the alternative delimiters
as shown on the right: >

    float |foo| = 1221;                   float /*foo*/ = 1221;
    float |bar| = 324;                    float /*bar*/ = 324;
    System.out.println(foo * bar);        System.out.println(foo * bar);

                                                     *'NERDBlockComIgnoreEmpty'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

This option  affects visual-block mode commenting. If this option is turned
on, lines that begin outside the right boundary of the selection block will be
ignored.

For example, if you are commenting this chunk of c code in visual-block mode
(where the '|'s are used to represent the visual-block boundary) >
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
   |int| main(){
   |   | printf("SUCK THIS\n");
   |   | while(1){
   |   |     fork();
   |   | }
   |}  |
<
If NERDBlockComIgnoreEmpty=0 then this code will become: >
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    /*int*/ main(){
    /*   */ printf("SUCK THIS\n");
    /*   */ while(1){
    /*   */     fork();
    /*   */ }
    /*}  */
<
Otherwise, the code block would become: >
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    /*int*/ main(){
    printf("SUCK THIS\n");
    while(1){
        fork();
    }
    /*}  */
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     *'NERDCommentEmptyLines'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 0.

This option affects commenting of empty lines. If this option is turned on,
then empty lines will be commented as well. Useful when commenting regions of
code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                *'NERDCommentWholeLinesInVMode'*
Values: 0, 1 or 2.
Default: 0.

By default the script tries to comment out exactly what is selected in visual
mode (v). For example if you select and comment the following c code (using |
to represent the visual boundary): >
    in|t foo = 3;
    int bar =| 9;
    int baz = foo + bar;
<
This will result in: >
    in/*t foo = 3;*/
    /*int bar =*/ 9;
    int baz = foo + bar;
<
But some people prefer it if the whole lines are commented like: >
    /*int foo = 3;*/
    /*int bar = 9;*/
    int baz = foo + bar;
<
If you prefer the second option then stick this line in your vimrc: >
    let NERDCommentWholeLinesInVMode=1
<

If the filetype you are editing only has no multipart delimiters (for example
a shell script) and you hadn't set this option then the above would become >
    in#t foo = 3;
    #int bar = 9;
<
(where # is the comment delimiter) as this is the closest the script can
come to commenting out exactly what was selected. If you prefer for whole
lines to be commented out when there is no multipart delimiters but the EXACT
text that was selected to be commented out if there IS multipart delimiters
then stick the following line in your vimrc: >
    let NERDCommentWholeLinesInVMode=2
<

Note that this option does not affect the behaviour of commenting in
|visual-block| mode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *'NERDCreateDefaultMappings'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

If set to 0, none of the default mappings will be created.

See also |NERDComMappings|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *'NERDCustomDelimiters'*
Values: A map (format specified below).
Default: {}

Use this option if you have new filetypes you want the script to handle, or if
you want to override the default delimiters of a filetype.

Example: >
    let g:NERDCustomDelimiters = {
        \ 'ruby': { 'left': '#', 'leftAlt': 'FOO', 'rightAlt': 'BAR' },
        \ 'grondle': { 'left': '{{', 'right': '}}' }
    \ }
<

Here we override the delimiter settings for ruby and add FOO/BAR as alternative
delimiters. We also add {{ and }} as delimiters for a new filetype called
'grondle'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *'NERDRemoveAltComs'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 1.

When uncommenting a line (for a filetype with an alternative commenting style)
this option tells the script whether to look for, and remove, comment
delimiters of the alternative style.

For example, if you are editing a c++ file using // style comments and you go
|<Leader>|cu on this line: >
    /* This is a c++ comment baby! */
<
It will not be uncommented if the NERDRemoveAltComs is set to 0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       *'NERDRemoveExtraSpaces'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default: 0.

By default, the NERD commenter will remove spaces around comment delimiters if
either:
1. |'NERDSpaceDelims'| is set to 1.
2. NERDRemoveExtraSpaces is set to 1.

This means that if we have the following lines in a c code file: >
    /* int foo = 5; */
    /* int bar = 10; */
    int baz = foo + bar
<
If either of the above conditions hold then if these lines are uncommented
they will become: >
    int foo = 5;
    int bar = 10;
    int baz = foo + bar
<
Otherwise they would become: >
     int foo = 5;
     int bar = 10;
    int baz = foo + bar
<

Note: When using 'start' as the default alignment, the enabling of
NERDRemoveExtraSpaces will still result in the removal of a space after the
delimiter.  This can be undesirable since aligning the delimiters at the very
start of the line (index 0) will usually result in spaces between the comment
delimiters and the text which probably shouldn't be removed.  So when using
'start' as the default alignment, take care to also disable
NERDRemoveExtraSpaces.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                  *'NERDLPlace'*
                                                                  *'NERDRPlace'*
Values: arbitrary string.
Default:
    NERDLPlace: "[>"
    NERDRPlace: "<]"

These options are used to control the strings used as place-holder delimiters.
Place holder delimiters are used when performing nested commenting when the
filetype supports commenting styles with both left and right delimiters.
To set these options use lines like: >
    let NERDLPlace="FOO"
    let NERDRPlace="BAR"
<
Following the above example, if we have line of c code: >
    /* int horse */
<
and we comment it with |<Leader>|cn it will be changed to: >
    /*FOO int horse BAR*/
<
When we uncomment this line it will go back to what it was.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                *'NERDMenuMode'*
Values: 0, 1, 2, 3.
Default: 3

This option can take 4 values:
    "0": Turns the menu off.
    "1": Turns the 'comment' menu on with no menu shortcut.
    "2": Turns the 'comment' menu on with <alt>-c as the shortcut.
    "3": Turns the 'Plugin -> comment' menu on with <alt>-c as the shortcut.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *'NERDUsePlaceHolders'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default 1.

This option is used to specify whether place-holder delimiters should be used
when creating a nested comment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *'NERDSpaceDelims'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default 0.

Some people prefer a space after the left delimiter and before the right
delimiter like this: >
    /* int foo=2; */
<
as opposed to this: >
    /*int foo=2;*/
<
If you want spaces to be added then set NERDSpaceDelims to 1 in your vimrc.

See also |'NERDRemoveExtraSpaces'|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *'NERDTrimTrailingWhitespace'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default 0.

When uncommenting an empty line some whitespace may be left as a result of
alignment padding. With this option enabled any trailing whitespace will be
deleted when uncommenting a line.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *'NERDDefaultAlign'*
Values: 'none', 'left', 'start', 'both'
Default 'none'.

Specifies the default alignment to use when inserting comments.

Note: When using 'start' as the default alignment be sure to disable
NERDRemoveExtraSpaces.  See the note at the bottom of |NERDRemoveExtraSpaces|
for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *'NERDCompactSexyComs'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default 0.

Some people may want their sexy comments to be like this: >
    /* Hi There!
     * This is a sexy comment
     * in c */
<
As opposed to like this: >
    /*
     * Hi There!
     * This is a sexy comment
     * in c
     */
<
If this option is set to 1 then the top style will be used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *'NERDDefaultNesting'*
Values: 0 or 1.
Default 1.

When this option is set to 1, comments are nested automatically. That is, if
you hit |<Leader>|cc on a line that is already commented it will be commented
again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 Default delimiter customisation                     *NERDComDefaultDelims*

If you want the NERD commenter to use the alternative delimiters for a
specific filetype by default then put a line of this form into your vimrc: >
    let g:NERDAltDelims_<filetype> = 1
<
Example: java uses // style comments by default, but you want it to default to
/* */ style comments instead. You would put this line in your vimrc: >
    let g:NERDAltDelims_java = 1
<

See |NERDComAltDelim| for switching commenting styles at runtime.

==============================================================================
5. Key mapping customisation                                *NERDComMappings*

To change a mapping just map another key combo to the internal <plug> mapping.
For example, to remap the |NERDComComment| mapping to ",omg" you would put
this line in your vimrc: >
    map ,omg <plug>NERDCommenterComment
<
This will stop the corresponding default mappings from being created.

See the help for the mapping in question to see which <plug> mapping to
map to.

See also |'NERDCreateDefaultMappings'|.

==============================================================================
6. Issues with the script                                      *NERDComIssues*


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1 Delimiter detection heuristics                         *NERDComHeuristics*

Heuristics are used to distinguish the real comment delimiters

Because we have comment mappings that place delimiters in the middle of lines,
removing comment delimiters is a bit tricky. This is because if comment
delimiters appear in a line doesn't mean they really ARE delimiters. For
example, Java uses // comments but the line >
    System.out.println("//");
<
clearly contains no real comment delimiters.

To distinguish between ``real'' comment delimiters and ``fake'' ones we use a
set of heuristics. For example, one such heuristic states that any comment
delimiter that has an odd number of non-escaped " characters both preceding
and following it on the line is not a comment because it is probably part of a
string. These heuristics, while usually pretty accurate, will not work for all
cases.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2 Nesting issues                                            *NERDComNesting*

If we have some line of code like this: >
    /*int foo */ = /*5 + 9;*/
<
This will not be uncommented legally. The NERD commenter will remove the
"outer most" delimiters so the line will become: >
    int foo */ = /*5 + 9;
<
which almost certainly will not be what you want. Nested sets of comments will
uncomment fine though. E.g.: >
    /*int/* foo =*/ 5 + 9;*/
<
will become: >
    int/* foo =*/ 5 + 9;
<
(Note that in the above examples I have deliberately not used place holders
for simplicity)

==============================================================================
7. About                                                        *NERDComAbout*

SublimeLinter 1.6.5 changelog

NEW FEATURES

- Added a (Ruby) Haml linter based on `haml -c`. For more information about
  Haml, please see http://haml.info.

- Added a simple Git commit message linter. This linter follows the rules as
  defined by http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html


CHANGES/FIXES

- Updated several links to point to the SublimeLinter's new Github location.

- "Ruby on Rails" syntax maps to "ruby" as part of the default settings.

- Linter arguments are now consistently defined as arrays (instead of tuples).

- Syntax map settings are no longer (sometimes) case-sensitive.

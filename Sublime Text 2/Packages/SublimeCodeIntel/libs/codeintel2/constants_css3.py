It sets \'appearance\' to the specified value and the\nother properties to their appropriate system value; \'normal\' resets \'appearance\'to\' normal \' and the others to \'inherit\'. The \'appearance\' property does not affect the\nspecified or computed values of any other properties. If \'appearance\' is not \'normal\', the UA must render the element as\nif it was the specified user interface (UI) control from the platform. The UA\nshould use the computed values of the \'background-*\', \'border-*\', \'padding-*\', \'outline-*\', and \'text-decoration\' properties when they do not have\ntheir initial values and the computed values of \'color\', \'font\', and \'cursor\' (whatever their values) to influence the\nrendering where possible. Any values from those properties that cannot be\nused to influence the rendering of the UI control must not affect the\nrendering at all. For example, the UA should not draw a second border\naround a UI control that already has a border. If \'background-color\'or\'background-image\' have non-initial values and the UA\nis using their values for influencing the rendering of the UI control, then\nthe UA must ensure that the \'color\' property is\nalso used to influence the rendering. Similarly if <span class="property">\'color\'</span> is used to influence the rendering, then <span class="property">\'background-color\'</span> must be used to influence the rendering, and the other <span class="property">\'background-*\'</span> properties should be used to influence the rendering as well. Other properties must not affect the handling of \'appearance\' and must\ninstead be applied according to normal CSS rules. In particular \'margin\', \'display\', \'float\', \'height\', \'width\', and \'line-height\', are not ignored and affect the\nelement as normal. This specification does not define the term "platform". For example, it could be the native graphical rendering\nengine of the operating system, or it could be a user-agent-specific skin. In\naddition, which of several toolkits to use could also be decided on an\nelement-by-element basis depending on the values of the \'background-color\', \'background-image\', \'border-*-style\', and \'outline-style\' properties, so that the\nauthor styles could be honored while still honoring \'appearance\' even though the UA is unable to\ninfluence the rendering of OS native UI controls. Note. The exact list of properties set\nby, influencing, and not affected by \'appearance\' given in the lists above may be\nadjusted based on UA implementor feedback. Appearance values take into account the user interface state (if any) of\nthe element; thus there is no need for separate values for enabled vs.\ndisabled checkboxes for example. Example(s): Influencing the color and\nbackground-color of a button This example demonstrates setting the color and background-color of an\nelement that is set to \' appearance:push-button \'. sample CSS: input[type=button] { appearance:push-button; /* expected from UA defaults */\n} input[type=button].custom { color: #393; background-color: #9cf; } sample (X)HTML fragment: <input type="button" value="Plain button" /> <input type="button" value="With color" class="custom" /> A graphical browser might render\nthese buttons as follows: First, a rounded button\nwith black text on a white background, with shades of gray being used near\nthe edges to give the impression of depth.

{       'description': "The two length or percentage values of the 'border-*-radius' properties define the radii of a quarter ellipse that defines the shape of the corner of the outer border edge (see the diagram below). The first value is the horizontal radius, the second the vertical radius. If the second value is omitted it is copied from the first. If either length is zero, the corner is square, not rounded. Percentages for the horizontal radius refer to the width of the border box, whereas percentages for the vertical radius refer to the height of the border box. The two values of ' border-top-left-radius: 55pt 25pt ' define the curvature of the corner. The two values of ' border-top-left-radius: 55pt 25pt ' define the curvature of the corner. The 'border-radius' shorthand sets all four 'border-*-radius' properties. If values are given before and after the slash, then the values before the slash set the horizontal radius and the values after the slash set the vertical radius. If there is no slash, then the values set both radii equally. The four values for each radii are given in the order top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. If bottom-left is omitted it is the same as top-right. If bottom-right is omitted it is the same as top-left. If top-right is omitted it is the same as top-left. border-radius: 4em; is equivalent to border-top-left-radius: 4em;\nborder-top-right-radius: 4em;\nborder-bottom-right-radius: 4em;\nborder-bottom-left-radius: 4em; and border-radius: 2em 1em 4em / 0.5em 3em; is equivalent to border-top-left-radius: 2em 0.5em;\nborder-top-right-radius: 1em 3em;\nborder-bottom-right-radius: 4em 0.5em;\nborder-bottom-left-radius: 1em 3em; 4.4.1. Corner ShapingThe padding edge (inner border) radius is the outer border radius minus the corresponding border thickness. In the case where this results in a negative value, the inner radius is zero. (In such cases its center might not coincide with that of the outer border curve.) Likewise the content edge radius is the padding edge radius minus the corresponding padding, or if that is negative, zero. The border and padding thicknesses in the curved region are thus interpolated from the adjoining sides, and when two adjoining borders are of different thicknesses the corner will show a smooth transition between the thicker and thinner borders. Note that this means that if the outer curve extends past the adjacent corner's padding edge, the inner curve may not be a full quarter ellipse. All border styles ('solid', 'dotted', 'inset', etc.) follow the curve of the border. The effect of a rounded corner when the two borders it connects are of unequal thickness (left) and the effect of a rounded corner on borders that are thicker than the radius of the corner (right). 4.4.2. Corner ClippingThe effect of a rounded corner when the two borders it connects are of unequal thickness (left) and the effect of a rounded corner on borders that are thicker than the radius of the corner (right). A box's backgrounds, but not its border-image, are clipped to the appropriate curve (as determined by 'background-clip'). Other effects that clip to the border or padding edge (such as 'overflow' other than 'visible') also must clip to the curve. The content of replaced elements is always trimmed to the content edge curve. Also, the area outside the curve of the border edge does not accept mouse events on behalf of the element. This example adds appropriate padding, so that the contents do not overflow the corners. Note that there is no border, but the background will still have rounded corners. DIV { background: black; color: white; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em } 4.4.3. Color and Style TransitionsThis example adds appropriate padding, so that the contents do not overflow the corners. Note that there is no border, but the background will still have rounded corners. DIV { background: black; color: white; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em }Color and style transitions must be contained within the segment of the border that intersects the smallest rectangle that contains both border radii as well as the center of the inner curve (which may be a point representing the corner of the padding edge, if the border radii are smaller than the border-width). The center of color and style transitions between adjoining borders is at the point on the curve that is at an angle that is proportional to the ratio of the border widths. For example, if the top and right border widths are equal, that point is at a 45 angle from the horizontal, and if the top is twice the width of the right the point is at a 30 angle from the horizontal. The line demarcating this transition is drawn between the point at that angle on the outer arc and the point at that angle on the inner arc. It is not defined what these transitions look like, but a gradient is recommended for color transitions that don't involve dotted or dashed borders. Given these corner shapes, color and style transitions must be contained within the green region. In case D the rectangle defined by the border radii does not include the center of the inner curve (which is a sharp corner), so the transition region is expanded to include that corner. Transitions may take up the entire transition region, but are not required to: For example, a gradient color transition between two solid border styles might take up only the region bounded by the tips of the outer radii and the tips of the inner radii (represented in case D by the dark green region). 4.4.4. Overlapping CurvesGiven these corner shapes, color and style transitions must be contained within the green region. In case D the rectangle defined by the border radii does not include the center of the inner curve (which is a sharp corner), so the transition region is expanded to include that corner. Transitions may take up the entire transition region, but are not required to: For example, a gradient color transition between two solid border styles might take up only the region bounded by the tips of the outer radii and the tips of the inner radii (represented in case D by the dark green region). Corner curves must not overlap: When the sum of any two adjacent border radii exceeds the size of the border box, UAs must proportionally reduce the used value of all border radii until none of them overlap. The algorithm for reducing radii is as follows:Let f = min( L i / S i ), where i ? {top, right, bottom, left}, S i is the sum of the radii of the corners on side i, and L top = L bottom = the width of the box, and L left = L right = the height of the box. If f < 1, then all corner radii are reduced by multiplying them by f. Note that this formula ensures that quarter circles remain quarter circles and large radii remain larger than smaller ones, but it may reduce corners that were already small enough, which may make borders of nearby elements that should look the same look different. If the curve interferes with UI elements such as scrollbars, the UA may further reduce the used value of the affected border radii (and only the affected border radii) as much as necessary, but no more. The rendering of the box must be exactly the same as if the reduced border-radius values were those originally specified. For example, the borders A and D of the figure below might be the result of box-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em The height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus 2.5em). However, if the height is only 2em, box-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em all corners need to be reduced by a factor 0.8 to make them fit. The used border radii thus are 0.4em (instead of 0.5em) and 1.6em (instead of 2em). See borders B and C in the figure. These rounded corner might be the result of ' width: 6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em ' for A and D; and ditto but with ' height: 2em ' for B and C. 4.4.5. Effect on TablesFor example, the borders A and D of the figure below might be the result of box-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2emThe height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus 2.5em). However, if the height is only 2em, box-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2emall corners need to be reduced by a factor 0.8 to make them fit. The used border radii thus are 0.4em (instead of 0.5em) and 1.6em (instead of 2em). See borders B and C in the figure. These rounded corner might be the result of ' width: 6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em ' for A and D; and ditto but with ' height: 2em ' for B and C. These rounded corner might be the result of ' width: 6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em ' for A and D; and ditto but with ' height: 2em ' for B and C. The 'border-radius' properties do apply to 'table'and'inline-table' elements. When 'border-collapse'is'collapse', the UA may apply the border-radius properties to 'table'and'inline-table' elements, but is not required to. In this case not only must the border radii of adjacent corners not intersect, but the horizontal and vertical radii of a single corner may not extend past the boundaries of the cell at that corner (i.e. the cell's other corners must not be affected by this corner's border-radius). If the computed values of the border radii would cause this effect, then the used values of all the border radii of the table must be reduced by the same factor so that the radii neither intersect nor extend past the boundaries of their respective corner cells. The effect of border-radius on internal table elements is undefined in CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders, but may be defined in a future specification. CSS3 UAs should ignore border-radius properties applied to internal table elements when 'border-collapse'is'collapse'.

Transitions may take up the entire transition region, but are not required to: For example, a gradient color transition between two solid border styles might take up only the region bounded by the tips of the outer radii and the tips of the inner radii (represented in case D by the dark green region). Corner curves must not overlap: When the sum of any two adjacent border radii exceeds the size of the border box, UAs must proportionally reduce the used value of all border radii until none of them overlap. The algorithm for reducing radii is as follows:Let f = min( L i / S i ), where i ? {top, right, bottom, left}, S i is the sum of the radii of the corners on side i, and L top = L bottom = the width of the box, and L left = L right = the height of the box. If f < 1, then all corner radii are reduced by multiplying them by f. Note that this formula ensures that quarter circles remain quarter circles and large radii remain larger than smaller ones, but it may reduce corners that were already small enough, which may make borders of nearby elements that should look the same look different. If the curve interferes with UI elements such as scrollbars, the UA may further reduce the used value of the affected border radii (and only the affected border radii) as much as necessary, but no more. The rendering of the box must be exactly the same as if the reduced border-radius values were those originally specified. For example, the borders A and D of the figure below might be the result of box-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2.5em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em The height (2.5em) is enough for the specified radii (0.5em plus 2.5em). However, if the height is only 2em, box-sizing: border-box;\nwidth: 6em;\nheight: 2em;\nborder-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em all corners need to be reduced by a factor 0.8 to make them fit. The used border radii thus are 0.4em (instead of 0.5em) and 1.6em (instead of 2em). See borders B and C in the figure. These rounded corner might be the result of ' width: 6em; height: 2.5em; border-radius: 0.5em 2em 0.5em 2em ' for A and D; and ditto but with ' height: 2em ' for B and C. 4.4.5.

The 'border-radius' properties do apply to 'table'and'inline-table' elements. When 'border-collapse'is'collapse', the UA may apply the border-radius properties to 'table'and'inline-table' elements, but is not required to. In this case not only must the border radii of adjacent corners not intersect, but the horizontal and vertical radii of a single corner may not extend past the boundaries of the cell at that corner (i.e. the cell's other corners must not be affected by this corner's border-radius). If the computed values of the border radii would cause this effect, then the used values of all the border radii of the table must be reduced by the same factor so that the radii neither intersect nor extend past the boundaries of their respective corner cells. The effect of border-radius on internal table elements is undefined in CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders, but may be defined in a future specification. CSS3 UAs should ignore border-radius properties applied to internal table elements when 'border-collapse'is'collapse'.

{       'description': "The two length or percentage values of the 'border-*-radius' properties define the radii of a quarter ellipse that defines the shape of the corner of the outer border edge (see the diagram below). The first value is the horizontal radius, the second the vertical radius. If the second value is omitted it is copied from the first. If either length is zero, the corner is square, not rounded. Percentages for the horizontal radius refer to the width of the border box, whereas percentages for the vertical radius refer to the height of the border box. The two values of ' border-top-left-radius: 55pt 25pt ' define the curvature of the corner. The two values of ' border-top-left-radius: 55pt 25pt ' define the curvature of the corner. The 'border-radius' shorthand sets all four 'border-*-radius' properties. If values are given before and after the slash, then the values before the slash set the horizontal radius and the values after the slash set the vertical radius. If there is no slash, then the values set both radii equally. The four values for each radii are given in the order top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. If bottom-left is omitted it is the same as top-right. If bottom-right is omitted it is the same as top-left. If top-right is omitted it is the same as top-left. border-radius: 4em; is equivalent to border-top-left-radius: 4em;\nborder-top-right-radius: 4em;\nborder-bottom-right-radius: 4em;\nborder-bottom-left-radius: 4em; and border-radius: 2em 1em 4em / 0.5em 3em; is equivalent to border-top-left-radius: 2em 0.5em;\nborder-top-right-radius: 1em 3em;\nborder-bottom-right-radius: 4em 0.5em;\nborder-bottom-left-radius: 1em 3em; 4.4.1. Corner ShapingThe padding edge (inner border) radius is the outer border radius minus the corresponding border thickness. In the case where this results in a negative value, the inner radius is zero. (In such cases its center might not coincide with that of the outer border curve.) Likewise the content edge radius is the padding edge radius minus the corresponding padding, or if that is negative, zero. The border and padding thicknesses in the curved region are thus interpolated from the adjoining sides, and when two adjoining borders are of different thicknesses the corner will show a smooth transition between the thicker and thinner borders. Note that this means that if the outer curve extends past the adjacent corner's padding edge, the inner curve may not be a full quarter ellipse. All border styles ('solid', 'dotted', 'inset', etc.) follow the curve of the border. The effect of a rounded corner when the two borders it connects are of unequal thickness (left) and the effect of a rounded corner on borders that are thicker than the radius of the corner (right). 4.4.2. Corner ClippingThe effect of a rounded corner when the two borders it connects are of unequal thickness (left) and the effect of a rounded corner on borders that are thicker than the radius of the corner (right). A box's backgrounds, but not its border-image, are clipped to the appropriate curve (as determined by 'background-clip'). Other effects that clip to the border or padding edge (such as 'overflow' other than 'visible') also must clip to the curve. The content of replaced elements is always trimmed to the content edge curve. Also, the area outside the curve of the border edge does not accept mouse events on behalf of the element. This example adds appropriate padding, so that the contents do not overflow the corners. Note that there is no border, but the background will still have rounded corners. DIV { background: black; color: white; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em } 4.4.3. Color and Style TransitionsThis example adds appropriate padding, so that the contents do not overflow the corners. Note that there is no border, but the background will still have rounded corners. DIV { background: black; color: white; border-radius: 1em; padding: 1em }Color and style transitions must be contained within the segment of the border that intersects the smallest rectangle that contains both border radii as well as the center of the inner curve (which may be a point representing the corner of the padding edge, if the border radii are smaller than the border-width). The center of color and style transitions between adjoining borders is at the point on the curve that is at an angle that is proportional to the ratio of the border widths. For example, if the top and right border widths are equal, that point is at a 45 angle from the horizontal, and if the top is twice the width of the right the point is at a 30 angle from the horizontal. The line demarcating this transition is drawn between the point at that angle on the outer arc and the point at that angle on the inner arc. It is not defined what these transitions look like, but a gradient is recommended for color transitions that don't involve dotted or dashed borders. Given these corner shapes, color and style transitions must be contained within the green region. In case D the rectangle defined by the border radii does not include the center of the inner curve (which is a sharp corner), so the transition region is expanded to include that corner. Transitions may take up the entire transition region, but are not required to: For example, a gradient color transition between two solid border styles might take up only the region bounded by the tips of the outer radii and the tips of the inner radii (represented in case D by the dark green region). 4.4.4.

In a right-to-left containing block, the first box is the rightmost on the first line and subsequent boxes are put to the left of it. For boxes broken across columns, the columns are treated as one continuous element, as if the column boxes were glued together in the block progression direction of the multi-column element. For boxes broken across pages, the page content areas are glued together in the block progression direction of the root element. In these cases, if the pieces have different widths (heights, if the root element / multi-column element is in vertical text mode), then each piece draws its background assuming that the whole element has the same width (height) as this piece. This ensures that right-aligned images stay aligned to the right edge, left-aligned images stay aligned to the left edge, and centered images stay centered."}},

    'box-flex':
{       'description': 'An element is flexible when the box-flex property is specified. The box-flex property is a floating point value representing the flexibility of the element. Its initial value is 0, which indicates that the element is inflexible. Elements that are flexible can shrink or grow as the box shrinks and grows. Whenever there is extra space left over in a box, the flexible elements are expanded to fill that space. All flex is relative. For example, a child with a box-flex of 2 is twice as flexible as a child with a box-flex of 1. A negative value for box-flex is not allowed. Flexible elements can be assigned to flex groups using the \'box-flex-group\' property. This property is a natural number value (the first flex group is 1 and higher values are later flex groups). The initial value is 1. In a horizontally oriented box, the preferred width of each child is computed. If the width of the margin box of each child is equal to the width of the containing block, then there is no extra space available, so the preferred widths are used for each child. If the width of the margin box adds up to a value smaller than the width of the containing block, then extra space is available. This extra space is divided up among the flexible children, as described below. If the width of the margin box adds up to a value larger than the width of the containing block, then the flexible children shrink as much as necessary to prevent overflow. Flexibility only applies to elements in normal flow. As absolute and fixed positioned elements are not in flow, any flexibility or flexgroup specified on them is ignored. In addition, as the \'float\' property does not apply to children of flexible boxes, they are considered part of normal flow and flexibility does apply. When dividing up extra space, first take all elements within the first flex group. Each element within that group should be given extra width based on the ratio of that element\'s flexibility compared to the flexibility of other elements within the same flex group. However, if the preferred width of the element plus the extra width allotted to it is larger than the maximum width of the element, then the width is set to that maximum width, and any remaining extra width beyond that is divided up among the other children. In this example there is 60 pixels of extra space available in the containing box. #div1 { display: box; width: 300px; } #button1 { box-flex: 1.0; width: 100px; } #button2 { box-flex: 2.0; width: 140px; } <div id="div1"> <button id="button1">Hello</button> <button id="button2">Goodbye</button> </div> As both child buttons are flexible, the extra space will be divided up between them. The first child button has a flexibility of 1.0 and the second child button has a flexibility of 2.0. The first button will receive 20 pixels of extra width and the second button will receive 40 pixels of extra width, maintaining the same ratio of extra width to flexibility values. This extra width is added to the preferred size of the element. However, if the second button had a maximum width of 150 pixels, it could only grow by 10 pixels before hitting this maximum size, so the remaining 30 pixels would instead be given to the first element, breaking the flexibility ratio. In this example there is 60 pixels of extra space available in the containing box. As both child buttons are flexible, the extra space will be divided up between them. The first child button has a flexibility of 1.0 and the second child button has a flexibility of 2.0. The first button will receive 20 pixels of extra width and the second button will receive 40 pixels of extra width, maintaining the same ratio of extra width to flexibility values. This extra width is added to the preferred size of the element. However, if the second button had a maximum width of 150 pixels, it could only grow by 10 pixels before hitting this maximum size, so the remaining 30 pixels would instead be given to the first element, breaking the flexibility ratio. More specifically, the percentage of extra space that an element may receive is calculated as follows:\' box-flex of child \' / \' total of box-flex values of child and all siblings \'If the width of all flexible children within the group has been increased to their maximum widths, the process repeats for the children within the next flex group, using any space left over from the previous flex group. Once there are no more flex groups, and there is still space remaining, the extra space is divided within the containing box according to the box-pack property. If the box would overflow after the preferred width of the children have been computed, then width is removed from flexible elements in a manner similar to that used when adding extra space. Each flex group is examined in turn and space is removed according to the ratio of the flexibility of each element. Elements do not shrink below their minimum widths. If all children have been shrunk to their minimum sizes, then the box overflows, although if the box-lines property is set to multiple, the box may be able to move elements to additional lines to prevent this. For vertically oriented boxes, the algorithm as described above is similar except using the height instead of the width. When a child box of a horizontally oriented box contains an inline element, it is likely that shrinking the width of the element due to flexibility may cause the inline element to grow in height, as the text within it may need to wrap to additional lines. Examples: #div1 { display: box; box-orient: vertical; height: 200px } <div id="div1"> <button>Cat</button> <button style="box-flex: 1">Piranha</button> <button>Antidisestablishmentarianism</button> </div> In the example above, the box is 200 pixels tall and is more than enough room for the three buttons. Because the first and third buttons are inflexible, they remain the same size, which is their intrinsic size. The second button is specified as being flexible, and because it is the only flexible element in the box, it receives all of the extra space. <div style="display: box; box-orient: vertical;"> <button style="box-flex: 1; height: 1000px;"> Cat </button> </div> In this example, if the height of the box is reduced, for instance, because the user resized the containing viewport, the height of the flexible button also shrinks with the box, despite the specification of 1000 pixels as the preferred height. It continues to shrink until the minimum required height for the button is reached, which here will likely be the height needed to display the button\'s label and border. After that, the button can shrink no further. Elements within a box can therefore have their own notions of minimum and maximum intrinsic sizes. In the above example, the button could not get any smaller than the minimum height required to draw its borders and its text. #div1 { display: box; } #iframe1 { box-flex: 1; min-width: 100px; max-width: 300px; height: 300px; } <div id="div1"> <iframe id="iframe1" src="http://www.mozilla.org/"/> </div> In this example, the iframe has a minimum width of 100 pixels and a maximum width of 300 pixels. If the containing box is less than 100 pixels wide, the iframe will overflow its containing div. If the containing box is between 100 pixels and 300 pixels inclusive, the width of the iframe would be set to that size, minus any necessary padding, borders and margins. If the width of the containing box is larger than 300 pixels, the extra space will be added inside the div. The extra space is added after the iframe inside the box. <p style="display: box;"> <button style="box-flex: 1; max-width: 50px;">Child 1</button> <button style="box-flex: 1; min-width: 50px;">Child 2</button> </p> In this example, the box has been stretched so that it is very wide. The first child has a maximum width of 50 pixels, and it divides the excess space equally with the second child until its maximum width has been reached. After that, since it is not allowed to grow any further, the remaining space all goes to the second child. 6 Packing along the box axis Name: box-pack Value: start | end | center | justify Initial: start Applies to: box elements Inherited: no Percentages: no Media: visual Computed value: specified valueExamples:In the example above, the box is 200 pixels tall and is more than enough room for the three buttons.

    'box-lines':
{       'description': 'By default a horizontal box will lay out its children in a single row, and a vertical box will lay out its children in a single column. This behavior can be changed using the box-lines property. The default value is single, which means that all elements will be placed in a single row or column, and any elements that don\'t fit will simply be considered overflow. If a value of multiple is specified, however, then the box is allowed to expand to multiple lines (that is, multiple rows or columns) in order to accommodate all of its children. The box must attempt to fit its children on as few lines as possible by shrinking all elements down to their minimum widths or heights if necessary. If the children in a horizontal box still do not fit on a line after being reduced to their minimum widths, then children are moved one by one onto a new line, until the elements remaining on the previous line fit. This process can repeat to an arbitrary number of lines. If a line contains only a single element that doesn\'t fit, then the element should stay on that line and overflow out of the box. The later lines are placed below the earlier lines in normal direction boxes and above in reverse direction boxes. The height of a line is the height of the largest child in that line. No additional space appears between the lines apart from the margins on the largest elements in each line. For calculating the height of a line, margins with a computed value of auto should be treated as having a value of 0. A similar process occurs for children in a vertical box. Later lines in normal direction boxes are placed to the right of earlier lines and to the left in reverse direction boxes. Once the number of lines has been determined, elements with a computed value for box-flex other than 0 stretch as necessary in an attempt to fill the remaining space on the lines. Each line computes flexes independently, so only elements on that line are considered when evaluating flex and flex-groups. The packing of elements in a line, as specified by the box-pack property, is also computed independently for each line. This example shows four buttons that do not fit horizontally. #div1 { display: box; box-lines: multiple; width: 300px; } button { box-flex: 1.0; width: 100px; } <div id="div1"> <button id="button1">Elephant</button> <button id="button2">Tiger</button> <button id="button1">Antelope</button> <button id="button2">Wildebeest</button> </div> The buttons are shrunk to their minimum widths, in this case calculated intrinsically. Assume that the four buttons have a minimum intrinsic width of 80 pixels. This will allow the first three buttons to fit in 240 pixels with 60 pixels left over of remaining space. Because the box-lines property has a specified value of multiple, the fourth button may be moved onto a second line. Flexibility is applied to each element, separately for each line. The first line has 60 pixels of remaining space, so each of the three buttons on that line will receive 20 pixels of extra width. The remaining button on a line of its own will stretch to the entire width of the containing box, or 300 pixels. If the box was resized, the buttons may rearrange onto different lines as necessary. If the style rules in the example above were changed to the following: #div1 { display: box; box-lines: multiple; box-pack: center; width: 300px; } button { box-flex: 1.0; width: 90px; max-width: 90px; } Now, each of the buttons will only stretch to include an additional 10 pixels of width, as the maximum width of 90 pixels is only 10 pixels larger than the minimum intrinsic width of the buttons. The remaining 30 pixels of space left over is divided up and placed inside the box outside of the buttons, as the value of box-pack is center. The fourth button will also appear at 90 pixels wide, centered within the box. 7.1 Multiple Lines and alignmentThis example shows four buttons that do not fit horizontally.

When the computed box-direction is normal, a box will display its elements starting from the lowest numbered ordinal group and ensure that those elements appear to the left (for horizontal boxes) or at the top (for vertical boxes) of the container. Elements with the same ordinal group are flowed in the order they appear in the source document tree. In the reverse direction, the ordinal groups are examined in the same order, except the elements appear reversed.

    'box-shadow':
{       'description': "The 'box-shadow' property attaches one or more drop-shadows to the box. The property is a comma-separated list of shadows, each specified by 2-4 length values, an optional color, and an optional 'inset' keyword. Omitted lengths are 0; omitted colors are a UA-chosen color. Where <shadow> = inset? && [ <length> {2,4} && <color> ? ]The components of each <shadow> are interpreted as follows: The first length is the horizontal offset of the shadow. A positive value draws a shadow that is offset to the right of the box, a negative length to the left. The second length is the vertical offset. A positive value offsets the shadow down, a negative one up. The third length is a blur distance. Negative values are not allowed. If the blur value is zero, the shadow's edge is sharp. Otherwise, the larger the value, the more the shadow's edge is blurred. See below. The fourth length is a spread distance. Positive values cause the shadow shape to expand in all directions by the specified radius. Negative values cause the shadow shape to contract. See below. Note that for inner shadows, expanding the shadow (creating more shadow area) means contracting the shadow's perimeter shape. The color is the color of the shadow. The 'inset' keyword, if present, changes the drop shadow from an outer shadow (one that shadows the box onto the canvas, as if it were lifted above the canvas) to an inner shadow (one that shadows the canvas onto the box, as if the box were cut out of the canvas and shifted behind it). An outer box-shadow casts a shadow as if the border-box of the element were opaque. The shadow is drawn outside the border edge only: it is clipped inside the border-box of the element. An inner box-shadow casts a shadow as if everything outside the padding edge were opaque. The inner shadow is drawn inside the padding edge only: it is clipped outside the padding box of the element. If the box has a nonzero 'border-radius', the shadow shape is rounded in the same way. The 'border-image' does not affect the shape of the box-shadow. If a spread distance is defined, the shadow is expanded outward or contracted inward by an operation equivalent to applying twice the absolute value of the spread value to a blur operation as defined below and thresholding the result such that for a positive spread distance all non-transparent pixels are given the full shadow color and for a negative spread distance all non-opaque pixels are made transparent. The UA may approximate this operation by taking an outward outset of the specified amount normal to the original shadow perimeter. Alternatively the UA may approximate the transformed shadow perimeter shape by outsetting (insetting, for inner shadows) the shadow's straight edges by the spread distance and increasing (decreasing, for inner shadows) and flooring at zero the corner radii by the same amount. (The UA may even combine these methods, using one method for outer shadows and another for inner ones.) For corners with a zero border-radius, however, the corner must remain sharp-the operation is equivalent to scaling the shadow shape. In any case, the effective width and height of the shadow shape is floored at zero. (A zero-sized shadow shape would cause an outer shadow to disappear, and an inner shadow to cover the entire padding-box.)A non-zero blur distance indicates that the resulting shadow should be blurred, such as by a Gaussian filter. The exact algorithm is not defined; however for a long, straight shadow edge, this should create a color transition the length of the blur distance that is perpendicular to and centered on the shadow's edge, and that ranges from the full shadow color at the radius endpoint inside the shadow to fully transparent at the endpoint outside it. The example below demonstrates the effects of spread and blur on the shadow:The example below demonstrates the effects of spread and blur on the shadow:The shadow effects are applied front-to-back: the first shadow is on top and the others are layered behind. Shadows do not influence layout and may overlap other boxes or their shadows. In terms of stacking contexts and the painting order, the outer shadows of an element are drawn immediately below the background of that element, and the inner shadows of an element are drawn immediately above the background of that element (below the borders and border image, if any). If an element has multiple boxes, all of them get drop shadows, but shadows are only drawn where borders would also be drawn; see 'box-decoration-break'. Shadows do not trigger scrolling or increase the size of the scrollable area. Below are some examples of an orange box with a blue border being being given a drop shadow. border:5px solid blue; background-color:orange; width: 144px; height: 144px; border-radius: 20px; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 10px 10px; box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 10px 10px inset box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 10px 10px 0 10px /* spread */ box-shadow: rgba(0,0,0,0.4) 10px 10px 0 10px /* spread */ insetBelow are some examples of an orange box with a blue border being being given a drop shadow. The 'box-shadow' property applies to the ' ::first-letter ' pseudo-element, but not the ' ::first-line ' pseudo-element. Outer shadows have no effect on internal table elements in the collapsing border model. If a shadow is defined for single border edge in the collapsing border model that has multiple border thicknesses (e.g. an outer shadow on a table where one row has thicker borders than the others, or an inner shadow on a rowspanning table cell that adjoins cells with different border thicknesses), the exact position and rendering of its shadows are undefined. 7.

If two values are specified, the first is the horizontal and the second is the vertical offset. If an element has only been floated horizontally (e.g., by setting \' float: right \'), this property will only offset the float horizontally, even if a vertical value also has been specified. Likewise, if an element has only been floated vertically, this property will only offset the float vertically. If an element has been floated both horizontally and vertically, this property will offset both horizontally and vertically. If no vertical value has been specified, the vertical offset is set to zero. If the \'gr\' unit or percentage unit is used, it means that the middle of the float should be aligned with the specified grid line (or portion thereof). If another unit is used, it means that the float is pushed a distance equal to the specified length.\'float-offset\' is a good concept for moving a float into the right position. For completeness it should apply to absolute positioning as well. We should reuse existing naming conventions already in place for abspos elements (e.g., \'offset-left, \'right\', or call it \' shift left, \'shift right\' etc.).

    'font-size-adjust':
{       'description': 'For any given font size, the apparent size and legibility of text varies across fonts. For scripts such as Latin or Cyrillic that distinguish between upper and lowercase letters, the relative height of lowercase letters compared to their uppercase counterparts is a determining factor of legibility. This is commonly referred to as the aspect value. Precisely defined, it is equal to the x-height of a font divided by the font size. In situations where font fallback occurs, fallback fonts may not share the same aspect ratio as the desired font family and will thus appear less readable. The font-size-adjust property is a way to preserve the readability of text when font fallback occurs. It does this by adjusting the font-size so that the x-height is the same irregardless of the font used. The style defined below defines Verdana as the desired font family, but if Verdana is not available Futura or Times will be used. p { font-family: Verdana, Futura, Times; } <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,...</p> Verdana has a relatively high aspect ratio, lowercase letters are relatively tall compared to uppercase letters, so at small sizes text appears legible. Times has a lower aspect ratio and so if fallback occurs, the text will be less legible at small sizes than Verdana. The style defined below defines Verdana as the desired font family, but if Verdana is not available Futura or Times will be used. Verdana has a relatively high aspect ratio, lowercase letters are relatively tall compared to uppercase letters, so at small sizes text appears legible. Times has a lower aspect ratio and so if fallback occurs, the text will be less legible at small sizes than Verdana. How text rendered in each of these fonts compares is shown below, the columns show text rendered in Verdana, Futura and Times. The same font-size value is used across cells within each row and red lines are included to show the differences in x-height. In the upper half each row is rendered in the same font-size value. The same is true for the lower half but in this half the font-size-adjust property is also set so that the actual font size is adjusted to perserve the x-height across each row. Note how small text remains relatively legible across each row in the lower half. Text with and without the use of font-size-adjustText with and without the use of font-size-adjustThis property allows authors to specify an aspect value for an element that will effectively preserve the x-height of the first choice font, whether it is substituted or not.

That can be accomplished with the following simple CSS rule: ruby.bopomofo { writing-mode: tb-rl } Note: The Bopomofo transcription is written in the normal way as part of the ruby text. The user agent is responsible for ensuring the correct relative alignment and positioning of the glyphs, including those corresponding to the tone marks, when displaying as vertical ruby.',

Information on line breaking conventions can be found in [ JIS4051 ] for Japanese, [ ???? ] for Chinese, and [?] for Korean, and in [ UAX14 ] for all scripts in Unicode. The CSS Working Group notes that although UAX 14 contains a wealth of information about line breaking conventions, a literal implementation of its algorithm has been found to be inadequate in multiple situations.

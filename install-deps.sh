# my magic photobooth symlink -> dropbox. I love it.
# first move Photo Booth folder out of Pictures and into dropbox/public
# then:
ln -s ~/Dropbox/Public/Photo\ Booth/ ~/Pictures/Photo\ Booth
# now you can record photobooth videos quickly and they upload to dropbox DURING RECORDING
# then you grab public URL and send off your video message in a heartbeat.
